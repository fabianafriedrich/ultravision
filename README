Create ultravision database in your localhost mySQL.

To change the connection to the database, access the application.properties configuration file that is inside the resources package.
Put your Database settings. ie: user, password, database name. And change the port on my computer mySQL runs on port 3307.
To run the application you have to run the main method of the UltravisionApplication class that is inside the utravision package.

The application is using JFrame to the GUI, and the back-end Java8 with Spring Framework(Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA) and mySQL database.
I am not sending a Database because it is just run the application that the tables will be created automatically.
You will be able to add all the data using the system.
